It's not a new bike unfortunately but we hope you like our Christmas gift all the same... 

You've heard about PSD2, Open Banking, AISPs and PISPs but what does a PISP payment look like exactly? For end users who are used to paying by card or through PayPal, will they actually be interested in using an Open Banking payment? 

It's all about ease of use and **minimising friction** and we think we've made it as simple as it can be. See the example below...


<div class="panel-group" id="accordion">
                    <div class="panel panel-default">
                        <div class="panel-heading">
                            <h4 class="panel-title">
                                <a class="noCrossRef accordion-toggle" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#collapseOne">Show Me! >> </a>
                            </h4>
                        </div>
                        <div id="collapseOne" class="panel-collapse collapse noCrossRef">
                            <div class="panel-body">
                            <center><img src ="images/pisp-shoppers.gif"></center>

                            </div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    </div>
