The Redirect option allows you to send your customers to our site to complete the electronic mandate sign up process.

Once the mandate has been signed your payer is then redirected to your Web site via a Success or Failure page, which you configure with us when you are first set up on Nuapay.

To get going with the Redirect approach you will need to:

* Generate an E-Mandate token
* Add a few lines of JavaScript to your Web site.
* Use a redirect call to display the Success or Failure page

To begin, you need to generate an E-Mandate token.
