{% include note.html content="A mandate is an agreement between a merchant and a customer in which the customer (the payer) gives consent to the merchant to take funds from a nominated account either on a once-off basis or, more typically, for a recurring series of payments. <p>Electronic Mandates (E-Mandates) allow you to capture your payers' bank account details and retrieve their authorisation without the need for traditional paper-based mandates</p>." %}

We currently allow our merchants to integrate with our E-Mandates application through:

|<a href = "#">Overlay</a>| Your customers select to sign a mandate and an overlay window is generated positioned on top of your merchant site. This is a seamless experience for your users and they do not need to know that a third party is involved in the sign-up process.|
|Redirect| With a Redirect, users see a new tab or Window being opened when they click the Sign button.|
|WordPress| Our WordPress plug-in offers you the easiest integration option but is only available if your site has been built on WordPress.|
|Direct API| This option allows you the greatest control, allowing you to build your own client from the ground up using our powerful APIs.|
