Before you begin your implementation please ensure that you have:

* A valid *API Key*
* A *Creditor IBAN*
* The unique *Resource Identifier to the CSID*


You should also have discussed your configuration requirements with a member of our Customer Support team to ensure that the E-Mandate application is set up as required for you needs (see <a href ="em_configuration.html">Configuration</a>  for more details).


## Available End Points

Nuapay uses the JSON format to submit and retrieve data.

Note that in the API descriptions the endpoints use the LIVE URI.

We offer two separate endpoints for our E-Mandates API:

|LIVE| https://api.nuapay.com |
|Sandbox| https://sandbox.nuapay.com/ |
