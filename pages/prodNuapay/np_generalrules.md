<p>Note that all requests must:</p>

* Be sent via the HTTPS protocol
* Pass a specific API Key unique to each merchant, for authentication
* Originate from an allowed IP address (the allowed IP addresses will be configured for you when you register for the service)
* Include (at a minimum) the mandatory fields required for the specific request that is being made

<p>Specific configurations are also required on the E-Mandate application. Note that specific configurations must be carried out internally by Nuapay staff so please discuss your requirements with a member of our Customer Support team who will be able to assist you in this.</p>
