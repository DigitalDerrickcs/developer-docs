<p>A Direct Debit payment is linked to a mandate. The Direct Debit is <i>pulled</i> from your payer's account on the settlement date and credited to your merchant account. </p>
<p>Depending on your business model you may decide to create single Direct Debit payments or, more typically, configure a schedule of recurring payments.</p>
