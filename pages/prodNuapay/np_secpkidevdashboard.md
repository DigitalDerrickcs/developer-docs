PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) Management is used to generate a private key and signed certificate to be used in generating Jason Web Signatures (JWS) for non-repudiation in our REST endpoints.

To generate your private key and certificate navigate to the 'PKI Management' screen on the Developer Dashboard. If this is the first time using this screen the only button available to you will be 'Generate PKI Key', press this button to generate your Private key and signed certificate.
