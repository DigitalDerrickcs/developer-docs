## Payment Schedules

Direct Debit payments may be single, once-off payments but more typically they are grouped together so that a series, or schedule, of payments can be set up in one go.

For example, a yearly magazine subscription could be easily set up so that Direct Debit collections of €5 are taken each month so that €60 is collected in total over the course of a single year (12 x €5).

Nuapay provides two payment schedule options:

* Fixed Length
* Open-ended

In the <b>Fixed Length</b> model you can specify the amount to collect, the frequency and the number of payments to be collected.

With an <b>Open-Ended</b> schedule the amount and the frequency is specified however there is no set number of payments and collections will continue to be made indefinitely.
