Credit Transfers (CTs) allow you to transfer funds from your account to a beneficiary's account. With a CT, you (the merchant) become the payer and the person to whom you are transferring funds becomes the beneficiary.

Unlike Direct Debit payments where you pull funds from your payers' accounts, with a CT payment you push funds to a specific beneficiary account.
