As part of the registration process you will be provided with the following:

* An API Key
* (Optionally) A Technical account - this account is created and held in Origix IP - see the Accounts section for more details.



{% include callout.html content="A Technical Account is held on our system and mirrors the instant payment transactions incoming and outgoing on your settlement account, which is used by the Instant Payment scheme. A Technical Account is required if you do not have a settlement account in the Instant Payment Scheme and are acting as an affiliate of your bank. If you do have a settlement account with the scheme then we will not issue you with a technical account." type="primary" %} 

You will also need to:

* Provide us with one or more IP addresses from which you will be initiating your API requests.
* Create a Validate Account Endpoint.
* Provide the Endpoint details to your Account Manager, allowing us to configure your Financial Institution / PSP to process inbound Instant Payments.

Optionally we may provide you with logon credentials to access:

* A view of the instant payment movements on your technical account.
* The Developer Dashboard, a user interface allowing you to configure Webhooks.


{% include note.html content="As CAMT.053 account statements are provided to affiliates, access to your technical account via the Origix user interface may not be required. Similarly our Customer Support team can configure your Webhook Endpoint so you may not require Developer Dashboard access. Please discuss your requirements with your Account Manager." %}
