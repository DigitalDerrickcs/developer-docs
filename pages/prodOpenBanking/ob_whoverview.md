Webhooks are HTTP notifications, dispatched to a specified URL when certain Open Banking events are triggered. 

Webhooks may be managed: 
* Via The [Nuapay UI](ob_whconfiguration.html) via the Developer Dashboard (for **merchant** users only) 

Or 

* Through [APIs](ob_whconfigurationrest.html) (primarily for **partner** users).

{% include note.html content="Webhooks configuration via API is also available to merchant users" %}
