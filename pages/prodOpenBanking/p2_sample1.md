## Mandate Overview

<b>NOTE</b>: Each of your payers must sign a mandate before you can take any Direct Debit payments!

Direct Debits are a Pull payment method (you are pulling funds from your payers' accounts).

When paying for your service with Credit or Debit Cards, for example, your payers are fully in control of the payment and they decide when to credit funds to you. Card payments are Push payments (your payers push payments to you).

As a merchant, having the ability to initiate a pull payment is very powerful. To ensure that payers are safeguarded and are fully aware that you will be taking (pulling) payments from their accounts at certain points in time, they must formally agree to allow you to take these pull payments.

{% include note.html content="This agreement between the payer and merchant is the <b>Mandate</b>. It is a legal agreement that informs users that they are agreeing to have their bank account debited periodically and also provides them with full details of their refund rights." %}


## SEPA Guarantee

The following text must be displayed on all SEPA mandates:

{% include callout.html content="By signing this mandate form, you authorise (A) {Company Name} to send instructions to your bank to debit your account and (B) your bank to debit your account in accordance with the instructions from {Company Name}. As part of your rights, you are entitled to a refund from your bank under the terms and conditions of your agreement with your bank. A refund must be claimed within 8 weeks starting from the date on which your account was debited." type="primary" %} 


## Mandate Types

You may chose to collect mandates on paper, with a normal ink signature; alternatively mandates can be handled electronically (with authorisation being provided via a check box or SMS code, for example). Nuapay offers you the flexibility to choose either approach.

For more information on electronic mandates, see the <a href ="#">E-Mandates</a> section.

{% include note.html content="All your mandates must be linked to a specific SEPA identifier that is unique to your business. This identifier is the Creditor Scheme ID. If you don't already have one, a new Creditor Scheme ID will be assigned to your business when you complete your registration as a Nuapay business." %}
