Depending on how you intend to interact with the Open Banking APIs, it may be necessary to initially retrieve all the ASPSPs that are currently enrolled in Open Banking. 

If, for example, you intend to develop your own Select Bank user interface for your PISP application, you will need to offer your PSUs (your payers) a list of all the possible banks with which they may hold an account. The [Retrieve Banks](ob_getbank.html) endpoint will return all the currently enrolled banks.
